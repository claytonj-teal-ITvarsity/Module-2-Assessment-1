                            <h3>Giraffe</h3>
    <p>                          
    The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.

       The IUCN and most giraffe scientists currently recognise only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies.[21][22] During the 1900s, various taxonomies with 2 or 3 species were proposed.[23] In 2001, a two-species taxonomy was proposed.[24] A 2007 study on the genetics of giraffes, suggested six species.[20] A 2011 study using detailed analyses of the morphology of giraffes, and application of the phylogenetic species concept, described eight species of living giraffes.[25] A 2016 study also concluded that living giraffes consist of multiple species. The researchers suggested the existence of four species, which have not exchanged genetic information between each other for 1 to 2 million years.[26] Since then, a response to this publication has been published, highlighting seven problems in data interpretation, and concludes "the conclusions should not be accepted unconditionally".

      Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open woodlands. They prefer Acacieae, Commiphora, Combretum and open Terminalia woodlands over denser environments like Brachystegia woodlands.[39]:322 The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments.[87] Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring trees of the subfamily Acacieae and the genera Commiphora and Terminalia,[4] which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth rate.[11] They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit.[39]:324 A giraffe eats around 34 kg (75 lb) of foliage daily.[44] When stressed, giraffes may chew the bark off branches. Although herbivorous, the giraffe has been known to visit carcasses and lick dried meat off bones.
